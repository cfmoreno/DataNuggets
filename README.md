<h1>What is it?</h1>

DataNuggets was made in order to inform communities and interested people about small bits of data, one nugget at a time.

It was created in order to help me train my knowledge in data collection, data cleaning, data presentation and storytelling.

Python was used in Jupyter Notebooks along with requests, pandas and numpy libraries. Project included connecting into multiple public available APIs for data collection, for then parsing and cleaning, forming dataframes of ordered data and finally showing the output in pictures for sharing in social network

For a future iteraction with the project, it will include automating the creation of the image to be share-ready from the get go. Automating the whole process of extracting, cleaning and showcasing data all in the same python script
